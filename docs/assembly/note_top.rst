.. note:: Most jobs above will be started in the backgroud using the ``&`` at the end of each command, which allows you to continue working in the shell. 

You can watch your running jobs by typing ``top`` (hit ``q`` to exit ``top``). 

You can look into the log-files by typing e.g. ``less LOGFILE`` (hit ``q`` to quit) or ``tail -f LOGFILE`` (hit ``^C`` to quit).
