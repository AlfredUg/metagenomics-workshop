Ray Assembly
============

Ray is a parallel software that computes de novo genome assemblies with next-generation sequencing data.
Ray is written in C++ and can run in parallel on numerous interconnected computers using the message-passing interface (MPI) standard. See the `Ray home page <http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net/>`_ for more info.

Ray can be run by the following command using a kmer-length of 31. As our AWS instance has 16 cores, we specify this in the `mpiexec -n 16 ` command to let Ray know it should use 16 parallel MPI processes::

  mpiexec -n 16 Ray -k 31 -p read1.fq read2.fq -o ray_31 >& ray_31.log &

This will create the output directory `ray_31` and the final contigs are located in `ray_31/Contigs.fas` 
Again, let's get some  basic statistics on the contigs::

  getN50.pl -s 500 -f ray_31/Contigs.fas
