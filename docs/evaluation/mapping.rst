BBMap Read Mapping
==================

In this part of the tutorial we will look at the assemblies by mapping the reads to the assembled contigs.

BBMap: Short read aligner for DNA and RNA-seq data. Capable of handling arbitrarily large genomes with millions of scaffolds. Handles Illumina, PacBio, 454, and other reads; very high sensitivity and tolerant of errors and numerous large indels. Very fast.
