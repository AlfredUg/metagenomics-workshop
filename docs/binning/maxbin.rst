MaxBin Binning
===============

MaxBin is a software for binning assembled metagenomic sequences based
on an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. For users' convenience
MaxBin will report genome-related statistics, including estimated
completeness, GC content and genome size in the binning summary
page. See the `MaxBin home page
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxbin/>`_ for more info.
